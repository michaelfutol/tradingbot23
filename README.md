# TradingBot23

**Automated crypto futures mean-reversion bot with a paper trading GUI, persistent trade history, Telegram alerts, and optional Ohverlay desktop bubbles.**

Runs on Windows as a standalone EXE — no Python, no coding required for end users.

---

## What It Does

TradingBot23 selects a monthly loser basket from the configured top-50 market-cap universe, excluding stablecoins and unsupported futures symbols. Eligible dips must pass completed-candle rebound checks and risk guards before paper entry. A dip is not a guarantee of recovery or profit.

**Public market-data sources (availability and rate limits vary):**
- [CoinGecko](https://coingecko.com) — market cap rankings and 24h price changes
- [Binance public API](https://binance.com) — real-time prices for TP/SL monitoring
- Binance P2P public search — read-only USDT/PHP buy/sell ads for arbitrage monitoring

---

## Quick Start — Windows EXE (No Python needed)

1. For the latest pushed build, open [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/michaelfutol/tradingbot23/actions/workflows/build.yml), select the newest successful run, and download its `TradingBot23-Windows` artifact. Release assets update only when a release is published.
2. Extract the artifact into its own folder. Do not copy another person's `.env`, `data`, or `logs`.
3. Double-click `TradingBot23.exe` and complete the first-run setup. Read-only Binance keys are sufficient for paper trading; do not enable withdrawal permissions.
4. Review Settings, apply them, and press Resume. New installs remain paused until settings are confirmed.

The bot runs in **paper trading mode only**. It does not place real orders.

## Dashboard

The app has a full GUI with these tabs. The summary shows estimated net equity and separates realized net profit from open net P&L, modeled exit fees, and funding.

| Tab | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Open** | Open positions with entry price, cached current price, entry leverage, estimated net P&L%, TP, cross-liquidation estimate, age |
| **Risk** | Entry guards, kill switch, exposure limits, and decision log |
| **Charts** | Equity curve, trade return distribution, exit breakdown pie, cumulative P&L |
| **History** | Current-session closed trades, net expectancy, profit factor, exports, and a reset that archives the old session |
| **P2P Arb** | USDT/PHP P2P cycle command center with route sizing, net profit estimate, route grade, warnings, and journal |
| **P2P History** | Paper cycles and hold transactions with their balance changes |
| **Ledger** | Local operational and accounting events |
| **Settings** | Change leverage, TP%, SL on/off, capital, monthly contribution, max hold days, and view the next 12 contribution markers |

---

## Strategy

### Core Thesis

The strategy tests mean reversion in liquid, higher-market-cap futures coins. Market-cap rank does not establish safety: coins can continue falling, fail, or never regain the entry price. Judge results by net expectancy, profit factor, drawdown and open losses, not only closed-trade win rate. Cross margin shares collateral; it does not make leveraged losses safe.

### Rules

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Universe | Top 50 by market cap | Via CoinGecko free API, no key needed |
| Basket | Top 5 worst 24h performers | Locked monthly, refreshed on the 1st |
| Entry signal | Configured 24h dip plus rebound confirmation | Scanned every 5 minutes; a free slot alone does not trigger entry by default |
| Take profit | +1% NET (after all fees) | Gross price target auto-computed |
| Stop loss | Disabled by default | Optional; disabling it leaves expiry, funding and cross-account losses possible |
| Liquidation guard | Always active | Uses cross-margin account equity so free cash backs every futures paper position |
| Max hold | 3 days | Auto-close at market if TP not reached |
| Position size | 20% of portfolio | Dynamic compounding — grows with your portfolio |
| Engine | Futures 1x (default) | One-cycle paper entries/exits with futures fee and liquidation modeling |
| Leverage | 1x–20x (paper configurable) | Higher settings are for paper stress testing only |

### Execution Flow

```
1st of month ──► CoinGecko: fetch top 50 by market cap
                      │
                      ▼
                 Rank by 24h % change (ascending)
                      │
                      ▼
                 Lock top 5 losers as monthly basket
                      │
                      ▼
              Every 5 minutes:
                ├── Check open positions (TP / liquidation / expiry)
                ├── Scan basket coins for the configured dip
                ├── Validate fresh completed futures candles and rebound structure
                └── Open eligible candidates only if risk and cooldown checks allow
```

### Entry and Risk Filters

- **Optional stop-loss handling** — hard stops and emergency crash stops are opt-in; cross margin does not guarantee protection from account losses.
- **Loss cooldown** — after a stop hit on a coin, that coin is blocked for 24 hours to avoid stacking losses on a falling knife.
- **TP cooldown** — after a TP hit on a coin, waits 1 hour before re-entering the same coin (prevents scalping the same coin in a loop).
- **Dip required by default** — empty slots wait for an eligible dip rather than automatically staying invested.
- **Rebound confirmation** — two rising completed 15m closes, positive 1h momentum and a close above SMA20. Missing or stale analysis blocks entry.
- **Cost-aware reporting** — open net P&L estimates include original entry/exit fee assumptions and modeled funding. These estimates are not exchange-exact live balances.

### Telegram Alerts (Optional)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | From @BotFather on Telegram |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Your chat ID (get it from @userinfobot) |

**Setup:**
1. Message @BotFather → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Message @userinfobot → copy your ID
3. Paste both into `.env` — alerts activate immediately on next restart

**You'll receive alerts and dashboard controls for:**
- Every trade opened (coin, entry price, margin, leverage)
- Every trade closed (exit price, net P&L, portfolio value)
- Daily summary at midnight UTC
- `/dashboard` or the **Futures Dashboard** button for live portfolio figures
- `/p2p` or the **P2P Arb** button for live USDT/PHP route and paper ledger figures
- `/info` for the automation scope and manual P2P safety notes

### Ohverlay Bubble Alerts (Optional)

TradingBot23 can send short local notifications to Ohverlay v4 fish/bubble overlays. This uses only Ohverlay's localhost webhook; no exchange keys, Telegram tokens, or live-trading controls are sent.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `OHVERLAY_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable TradingBot23 to Ohverlay bubble alerts |
| `OHVERLAY_WEBHOOK_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:7277/message` | Local Ohverlay webhook endpoint |
| `OHVERLAY_SENDER` | `TradingBot23` | Sender label shown by Ohverlay |
| `OHVERLAY_MAX_CHARS` | `420` | Max bubble message length |

**Setup:**
1. Open Ohverlay v4.
2. From the Ohverlay tray menu, enable **Webhook Server**.
3. In TradingBot23 Settings, enable **Ohverlay alerts**, click **Apply Settings**, then click **Test**.

## Persistent Trade History

Every closed trade is appended to `data/trade_history.csv`. This file:
- Survives app restarts
- Is loaded on startup so stats (win rate, total P&L) are always correct
- Can be opened in Excel for analysis
- Is the data source for the History tab in the GUI
- Can be summarized from the History tab with **Export Report**

CSV columns: `open_time, close_time, symbol, engine, entry_price, exit_price, amount_usd, notional, leverage, pnl_pct, pnl_usd, funding_paid, reason, entry_change_24h`

Monthly paper contributions are tracked in `data/account_state.json` so restarts do not double-add the same month. The Settings tab shows a 12-month contribution schedule with paid/due/scheduled markers. Dashboard portfolio P&L uses total contributed capital, not only starting capital, so deposits are not counted as profit.

Changing `Capital (USD)` in Settings now syncs the active paper account: increases add free paper cash immediately, decreases withdraw from free cash only, and existing open trades keep their original margin/leverage.

---

## Futures Engine

TradingBot23 is futures-only by design. Spot support was removed because spot/OCO execution needs separate exchange cycles to complete a turnabout, while this app focuses on one-cycle futures-style paper entries and exits.

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| Execution | Paper-only futures simulation |
| Leverage | 1x–20x (default 1x, paper-only) |
| Fees | 0.06% per side on notional |
| Funding cost | ~0.03%/day modeled |
| Liquidation | Tracked; unsafe entries are refused |
| Real orders | Not implemented |

---

## P2P Arb And History

The **P2P Arb** tab uses live Binance P2P USDT/PHP listings for both paper simulation and live monitoring. It pulls ads once when opened, then refreshes every 60 seconds while the tab is selected. The **P2P History** tab shows the paper transaction ledger and watch-route journal.

P2P controls are durable. When valid P2P settings are used for refresh, recalculate, or paper actions, the app saves the current capital, min net %, transfer fee, buffer, delay, cancel %, decay %, mode, and automation toggles to `.env`, so refreshes and restarts keep the same control values.

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Best Buy USDT | Lowest seller price to buy USDT with PHP |
| Best Sell USDT | Highest buyer price to sell USDT for PHP |
| Route Calculator | Pairs buy/sell ads, caps size by capital and ad limits, and estimates net PHP profit |
| 500K Sweep | Simulates splitting a PHP amount across multiple real buy/sell listings with weighted average prices |
| Paper Arb | Compounds a local paper PHP balance from profitable live-listing depth sweeps; stored in `data/p2p_paper_arb.json` |
| Paper Hold | Buys paper USDT now, keeps one open inventory position, and auto-sells when the configured net profit threshold is reached |
| Live Assist | Can alert Telegram/Ohverlay and auto-log watchlist routes without changing the paper balance |
| Route Grade | A/B/C/WATCH/REVIEW label based on estimated return and counterparty filters |
| Journal | Logs the top route to `data/p2p_cycle_journal.csv` for manual cycle tracking |
| Transaction History | Records reset, capital adjustment, paper cycle, hold buy, and hold sell rows in `data/p2p_transaction_history.csv` |
| Tables | Top buy/sell ads with PHP limits, USDT available, payment methods, advertiser, finish rate, and order count |

The route and paper-hold estimates are informational only. The app does not place P2P orders, send fiat, mark payment complete, verify fiat receipt, release crypto, or handle disputes. Manual fiat verification is required before releasing crypto or treating any real cycle as complete.

### P2P Modes

| Mode | Action | What Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | Paper Buy+Sell | Simulates buy and sell from the same live listing snapshot. If net profit meets the threshold, PHP profit is added immediately and no USDT remains open. |
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | Paper Buy Hold | Simulates buying USDT from current live seller ads. Paper cash goes down, hold USDT appears, and the app waits for a later sell-side quote. |
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | Check/Sell Hold | Marks the open paper hold against current live buyer prices. It closes only when the configured net profit threshold is reached. |
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | TG Alerts | Sends paper buy/sell/hold events to enabled alert channels. |
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | Recalculate Only | Refreshes route math only. It never records a paper transaction. |
| Paper Sim (Live Data) | Auto Cycle | Runs only after fresh P2P listing refreshes and skips repeated fills when the listing set is unchanged. |
| Live Assist | Send Live Snapshot | Sends the current P2P dashboard to Telegram. No balances change. |
| Live Assist | Log Watch Route | Saves the current top route to `data/p2p_cycle_journal.csv`. No balances change. |

Use **Paper Sim (Live Data)** to test compounding behavior against real listings without placing orders. Use **Live Assist** when watching real listings and manually executing outside the app.

## Building the EXE (Developers)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikel-eidra/tradingbot23.git
cd tradingbot23
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller tradingbot23.spec --clean
```

The EXE appears in `dist/TradingBot23.exe`. Copy the entire `dist/` folder to share — the `.env` file must travel with the EXE.

## Risk Management

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| Paper mode only | No real orders are placed; live futures execution is not implemented |
| 1x leverage default | Lowest-risk futures setting with wide liquidation distance |
| Cross-margin liquidation | Free cash plus open-position equity backs all paper futures positions, so small 20x paper trades are not treated like isolated-margin positions |
| Liquidation guard | At any leverage, refuses new trades where the SL would breach the cross-liquidation price |
| One position per coin | Duplicate entries blocked at trader level |
| Cash safety check | Position size capped at available cash |
| Dynamic sizing | Losses reduce exposure automatically; gains increase it |
| Stablecoin filter | USDT, USDC, USDE, USD1, DAI, BUSD and others excluded from basket |
| Max hold enforcement | Stale positions auto-closed after configured holding period |
| TP/Loss cooldowns | Prevents re-entering a coin immediately after a win or loss |

---
